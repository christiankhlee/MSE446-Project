# Team Update: Data Preprocessing and EDA Complete

## Overview
Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis phases have been completed. The dataset is now ready for model development with comprehensive cleaning applied and key insights identified.

## Dataset Status
- **Total Samples**: 920 (no samples removed)
- **Missing Values**: 0 (fully cleaned)
- **Target Distribution**: 44.7% disease, 55.3% no disease (well-balanced)
- **Features**: 16 total (13 original + 3 missing indicators)
- **Data Quality**: Production-ready for ML modeling

## Key Findings

### Top Predictive Features
Based on correlation analysis with heart disease presence:

| Rank | Feature | Correlation | Clinical Significance |
|------|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1 | `cp` (Chest Pain Type) | 0.39 | Asymptomatic chest pain shows 80% disease rate |
| 2 | `thalch` (Max Heart Rate) | 0.38 | Lower max heart rates correlate with disease |
| 3 | `exang` (Exercise Angina) | 0.38 | Strong indicator of cardiac stress |
| 4 | `oldpeak` (ST Depression) | 0.37 | Cardiac stress response measure |
| 5 | `slope` (ST Segment Slope) | 0.34 | Exercise stress test pattern |
| 6 | `sex` (Gender) | 0.31 | Males show significantly higher disease rates |
| 7 | `age` | 0.28 | Disease prevalence increases with age |

### Important Patterns Identified

#### Chest Pain Categories
- **Type 0 (Asymptomatic)**: ~80% have disease - highest risk
- **Type 1 (Typical Angina)**: ~15% have disease - lowest risk
- **Type 2 (Atypical Angina)**: ~35% have disease
- **Type 3 (Non-anginal Pain)**: ~45% have disease

#### Exercise Response Patterns
- Exercise-induced angina strongly predicts disease
- Lower maximum heart rates associated with positive diagnosis
- ST segment changes during exercise are key diagnostic indicators

#### Demographic Insights
- Disease prevalence peaks in 50-60 age range
- Gender shows unexpected pattern: females in dataset have higher disease rates
- Age shows moderate but consistent correlation with disease presence

## Data Cleaning Approach

### Missing Value Strategy
**Standard Imputation** (features with <20% missing):
- Median imputation for continuous variables
- Mode imputation for categorical variables
- Applied to: `trestbps`, `chol`, `fbs`, `restecg`, `thalch`, `exang`, `oldpeak`

**Advanced Strategy** (features with >30% missing):
- Created missing indicator variables (`feature_missing`)
- Preserved information about missingness patterns
- Applied to: `slope`, `ca`, `thal`

### Data Processing
- Converted multi-class target to binary (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)
- Applied label encoding to all categorical features
- Standardized data types for consistency
- Removed unnecessary identifier columns

## Modeling Recommendations

### Suggested Algorithm Priority
1. **Random Forest / XGBoost**: Best suited for mixed data types and feature interactions
2. **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model with medical interpretability
3. **Support Vector Machine**: Good performance for this dataset size
4. **Gradient Boosting**: Often achieves best performance on tabular data

### Technical Considerations
- **Feature Scaling**: Required for LogReg, SVM, Neural Networks (not needed for tree-based)
- **Cross-Validation**: Use StratifiedKFold (5-10 folds) to maintain class balance
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Focus on Accuracy, Precision/Recall, ROC-AUC, F1-Score
- **Feature Engineering**: Consider interaction terms (`age * thalch`, `cp * exang`)

### Implementation Notes
```python
# Recommended CV setup
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Feature scaling (when needed)
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
```
